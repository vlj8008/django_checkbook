A module for an overall banking application, allowing users to create different accounts, and to add transactions and an accompanying description, to these accounts.
The module also provides a list of recent transactions and the current balance of each account. 


## Description

The module was made using the Django framework. The user interface was created using HTML and CSS

I used Django template inheritance to create stylized and consistent pages.
