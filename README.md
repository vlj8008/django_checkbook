# Checkbook Web Application

I used the Django framework to create a module of an overall banking application. 

My module allows a user to create different accounts, and to add transactions and an accompanying description, to these accounts.  

The module also provides a list of recent transactions and the current balance of each account. 

I used CSS and HTML to create the user interface. 

I used Django template inheritance to rapidly create stylized and consistent pages. I created the business logic to keep track of the balances of the various accounts.
